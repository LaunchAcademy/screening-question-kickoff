# Interview Practice

---

## Gotta Get Down on Friday...

While you recover and we grade systems checks, we will:

- Practice screening questions
- Practice whiteboarding

---

## Let's Talk About the Interview and What to Expect

- There is no such thing as a typical interview
- Usually includes one or some of the following:
    * Technical Screen / Coding Challenge
    * "Phone" Screen
    * Cultural Fit Interview
    * Job History Interview
    * Technical Interview
      - Pair Programming
      - Talking through a coding challenge
      - Whiteboarding

---

## They All Require Practice! So, we offer:

- Friday Screening Question Practice
- Friday Whiteboarding Practice
- Mock Coding Challenge (Assigned for weekend between 7 & 8)
- Mock Interview
- More Whiteboarding in small group project weeks

---

## So, I get it, how do I not suck at this?

Frameworks, Guidance, and Practice!

---

## The Primary Directive

### Build Rapport

People want team members they genuinely *like*.

---

## Nonverbal Communication

- Your hands should be visible
- Mirroring
- Make eye contact without intensity or awkwardness
- Use nonverbal communication to indicate thought
- Smile!

More on this from Alex later in the cohort...

---

## Mock Screening Questions Practice: Objectives

- Simulate interview screening questions
- Appraise your *domain knowledge*

---

### Domain Knowledge vs. Procedural Knowledge

- At Launch, we emphasize *procedural knowledge* (practice)
- Early in the interview process, you'll be assessed on *domain knowledge*

- Procedural knowledge in engineering is developing the capacity to *build* with technology
- Domain knowledge in engineering is about being able to speak and communicate about technical concepts

---

### How to Answer Screening Questions

- Respond with filler to avoid pregnant pauses
- Use nonverbal cues to indicate thought
- Qualify your confidence in the answer

---

### Initial Filler

- "Let me think a bit on that question..."
- "I know we covered that in my time with Launch..."
- "Hmmmm...."

---

### Guidance on Filler

- Do not use the same filler in every conversation
- Avoid filler if you're confident in your answer
- These are especially important in phone conversations

---

### Qualifying your response

- "I'm vaguely familiar, so let me try to address the question..."
- "I'm not super confident, but let me start with what I *do* know"
- "I have some strong opinions here, but if you wouldn't mind, give me a few seconds to collect my thoughts..."

---

### Nonverbal Communication

- Square your shoulders with the interviewer
- Make regular eye contact
- Indicate thought vs. active speaking
- Mirror

---

### Phone Screens

- Nonverbal communication will not serve you so...
- Be more intentional about your verbal communication
- *Actively* use responses to indicate needs for pausing and thought
- Use intonation as a way to both indicate emotions and moments of contemplation

---

## Whiteboarding / Technical Questions: A Framework

1. Repeat the question
2. Write notes ON THE BOARD
3. Write test cases down - consider right results, error conditions, and boundary conditions
4. Implement out loud
5. Trace and check with test cases
6. Discuss refactoring opportunity and performance tradeoffs
7. Conclude

---

## Other Whiteboarding Tips

- Don't forget about nonverbal communication
- Position yourself strategically
- Involve the interviewer in the process as much as possible

---

## When you don't know

- Don't bullshit
- Indicate your level of confidence
- Handle missteps in your follow up

---

## Asking Good Questions

- Make them contextual / reciprical
- Come from an informed place
- Indicate that you want to contribute to making them "look good"

---

## Concluding the Interview

- Eliminate any uncertainties or possible objections to clear up
- Thank the interviewer

---

## Following Up

- Contextualize the follow up
- Personalize it

---

## Debrief

- Journal 
  - what went well
  - what didn't go well
  - what you will focus on next time
- Debrief forms with Launch

---

### What to do when you don't know

- Don't panic
- Think out loud
- Walk the interviewer through how'd you approach the problem
- Demonstrate your resourcefulness
- In follow up, indicate you researched the question and now are knowledgeable about the question

---

### What not to do

- Don't bullshit
- Avoid long and awkward silence

---

### Today: Screening Questions

- We'll publish a list of frequently asked questions
- The questions are formatted to hide the answer
- Don't look at the answer until it is fully discussed

Recommended workflow: 

1. Someone volunteers to be asked the first question
1. Another group member asks them a random question from the top 5
1. Group provides feedback and assistance
1. Answerer picks person and question to ask next

---

### Today: Whiteboarding Practice

1. I'll break you up into pairs and spread you out around the space, and I'll supply a list of questions
1. One person will impersonate the interviewer
1. The other will practice whiteboarding
1. Follow the framework!

### Things to Keep in Mind

- Practice like you play!
- Imagine the individual that asked you is interviewing you
- Simulate your answer, use the strategies we just provided you

---

### Common Gotchas

- Follow the framework
- Be natural in playing back the question
- Pick and stick with a syntax
- If we ask you to write a function, don’t write the “inside” of the function, properly declare the function


### Some Items to Note

- It is likely you won't get to answer all questions
- The questions are provided to you as a study guide for potential interview questions
- Do not attempt to memorize the responses - take away key points
